# Challenge 2: Even or Odd

## Objective

Write a program that determines if a number is even or odd.

## Requirements

1. Read an integer from the user
2. Check if it's even or odd
3. Print the result

## Hint

Use the modulo operator `%`. A number is even if `number % 2 == 0`.

## Example

**Input:**
```
7
```

**Output:**
```
7 is odd
```

**Input:**
```
10
```

**Output:**
```
10 is even
```

## Bonus Challenge

Modify your program to check multiple numbers until the user enters 0.
