# Challenge 3: Calculate Factorial

## Objective

Write a program that calculates the factorial of a number.

## What is Factorial?

The factorial of n (written as n!) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

Examples:
- 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
- 3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6
- 0! = 1 (by definition)

## Requirements

1. Read a non-negative integer
2. Calculate its factorial
3. Print the result

## Hint

Use a for loop to multiply numbers from 1 to n.

## Example

**Input:**
```
5
```

**Output:**
```
120
```

## Bonus Challenge

Add error handling for negative numbers.
